    <h3>For the Tsaziki:</h3>

            <li>200g Greek yogurt</li>
            <li>small bunch mint, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 small garlic clove, crushed</li>
            <li>juice ½ lemon</li>

    <h3>To serve:</h3>

            <li>1 butter or round lettuce</li>
            <li>4 large tomatoes, seeds removed, chopped</li>
            <li>1 red onion, halved and thinly sliced</li>


    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Tip the chicken into a large bowl and add the marinade ingredients, <br>
            along with 1 tsp salt and plenty of black pepper. Mix well, ensuring each thigh is well coated. <br>
            Cover and chill for at least 3 hrs, or up to 48 hrs if you have time.</li>
            <br>

    <li>A few hours before you want to eat, make the pitta. In a bowl, mix the flour, <br>
        yeast, sugar and 1/ 2 tsp salt with your fingertips. <br>
        Add 150ml lukewarm water and 2 tsp olive oil, and combine to a dough. <br>
        Tip onto a work surface and knead for 8-10 mins (or use a tabletop mixer for 5 mins). <br>
        Clean, then lightly oil your bowl, return the dough and cover loosely with cling film. <br>
        Leave to rise for 1 hr or until nearly doubled in size.</li>
        <br>

    <li>Divide the dough into four equal pieces. Roll out to circles, as thin as you can. <br>
        Cover with sheets of oiled cling film and leave to rise for 15-20 mins.</li>
        <br>

    <li>To make the tzatziki, halve the cucumber lengthways and scoop out the seeds. Finely chop,<br>
        then combine with the remaining ingredients, along with a pinch of salt.<br>
        Chill until ready to serve.</l4>
        <br>

    <li>Heat the grill to its highest setting. Line a roasting tin with foil and find 4 metal skewers <br>
        long enough to sit across the top with a little space underneath. Remove the chicken from the fridge, <br>
        take one thigh and thread it over 2 skewers, so it has a skewer through either side. <br>
        Thread another piece of chicken on top, leaving a slight gap between each piece; <br>
        you should fit 6 thighs on each pair of skewers. <br>
        Position the skewers on top of the roasting tin and set aside while you finish the pittas.</li>
        </ol>
                    
</ul>

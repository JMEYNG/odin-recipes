<p1>        Pho Ga... The most famous of all Vietnamese dishes, "Ga", meaning "chicken" in Vietnamese is one of two ways this dish is served. <br>
            Today, that's what we're focussing on, because <b>who doesn't love chicken?!</b><br>
            Pho, is a noodle soup, packed with delicious flavours and loads of nutrients, something you could see yoursrelf eating<br>
            when you're feeling a little bit under the weather. Breakfast, lunch, or dinner, Pho is a staple!
            Lets get cracking.

    <h2>What You'll Need:</h2>
<ul>
            <li><b>Chicken – </b>I use chicken thighs for convenience (easier than man handling a whole chicken) but you can use a whole chicken too. <br>
                Do not sub with breast – we need to use dark meat here, and we need skin to maximise flavour into the broth!</li>

            <li><b>Leftover chicken – </b>We use some chicken to top the soup, but you will have leftovers – and it will be infused with lovely flavour! <br>
                See bottom of post for things to use it for;</li>

            <li><b>Spices – </b>cloves, fennel, star anise, coriander (fresh and seeds) and cinnamon – infuse the broth with the distinct Pho fragrance that you know and love so well!</li>

            <li><b>Onion and ginger – </b>these are aromatics that are charred first to add a hint of smokiness to the broth. A traditional and mandatory inclusion</li>

            <li><b>Fish sauce – </b>this provides more complexity and depth of flavour than soy sauce, as well as salt in the broth;</li>

            <li><b>Sugar – </b>Pho broth is actually a bit sweet. Most people don’t realise it because it’s subtle! But it’s there – and if you don’t use enough sugar, <br>
                you will notice something lacking in the broth;</li>

</ul>

    <h2>Method:</h2>    
<ol>
            <li><b>Char onion and ginger – </b>this provides a subtle smokey fragrance to the broth that is a signature feature of Pho. So char them well!</li>
            <li><b>Simmer everything gently for 1.5 hrs </b>to infuse the water with all those incredible broth flavourings; and</li>
            <li><b>Strain, </b>shred chicken, serve with Toppings!</li>
</ol>

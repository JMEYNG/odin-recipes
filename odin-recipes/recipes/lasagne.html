        <h2>What You'll Need:</h2>
<ul>
        <h3>For the meat sauce, you'll need:</h3>

            <li>Onion, garlic, carrot and celery – for the flavour base, a soffrito;</li>
            <li>Beef</li>
            <li>Canned tomato and tomato paste</li>
            <li>Red wine – for extra flavour!</li>
            <li>Seasonings – beef bouillon cubes (stock cubes), bay leaves, thyme, oregano, Worcestershire sauce</li>
        
            
    <h3>For the white sauce, you'll need:</h3>
    
            <li>butter</li>
            <li>flour</li>
            <li>milk</li>
            <li>cheese</li>

    <h3>For assembling, you need:</h3>
    
            <li>lasagna sheets – preferably fresh (from the fridge section of grocery stores) but dried works just fine too</li>
            <li>cheese!</li>
</ul>
    
    <h2>Method</h2>

        <h3>For the Ragu:</h3>
    <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a large heavy based pot over medium heat. Add garlic, onion, celery and carrots. Cook for 10 minutes until softened and sweet – they should not brown (if they do, turn heat down).</li>
            <li>Add beef, turn heat up and cook the beef, breaking it up as you go.</li>
            <li>Once the beef has all turned brown, add the remaining Ragu ingredients EXCEPT the sugar.</li>
            <li>Stir then adjust the heat so it is bubbling very gently. Place the lid on and cook for 1.5 – 2 hours, stirring every now and then, then remove the lid and simmer for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>The ragu is ready when the meat is really tender and the sauce has thickened and is rich – see video for consistency (Note 6). Adjust salt and pepper to taste, and add sugar if required (Note 3)</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>For the cheese sauce:</h3>
    <ol>
            <li>Warm milk up in a saucepan (optional – just makes sauce thicken faster).</li>
            <li>In a large saucepan, melt butter over medium low heat. Add flour and mix constantly for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Pour about 1 cup of the milk in, mixing as you go to incorporate into the flour mixture. Once mostly lump free, add remaining milk. Use a whisk if needed to make it lump free.</li>
            <li>Turn heat up to medium high. Stir occasionally at first then regularly after a few minutes until sauce thickens – about 5 – 8 minutes. It should coat the back of the wooden spoon.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat, add cheese, nutmeg, salt and pepper. Mix until the cheese is melted. The Sauce should be thick but still easily pourable – the consistency of heavy cream<br>
                (you need to be able to drizzle it over the Ragu when layering – see video). If it’s too thick, add a splash of water or milk.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Assemble:</h3>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F.</li>
        <li>Use a 33x22x7cm / 13x9 x2.5″ baking dish.</li>
        <li>Smear a bit of Ragu on the base, then cover with lasagna sheets. Tear sheets to fit.</li>
        <li>Spread over 2 1/2 cups of Ragu (enough to cover sheets), then drizzle over 1 cup of Cheese Sauce.</li>
        <li>Top with lasagna sheets (Note 7). Spread with another 2 1/2 cups of Ragu, then 1 cup of Cheese Sauce. <br>
            Top with lasagna sheets then repeat 1 more time.</li>
        <li>Top with a 4th layer of lasagna sheets, then pour over the remaining Cheese Sauce.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with Mozzarella, then bake for 25 minutes or until golden and bubbling.</li>
        <li>Stand for 5 to 10 minutes before cutting and serving, garnished with basil or parsley if desired.</li>
    </ol>
